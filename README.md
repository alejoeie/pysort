Sometimes we struggle when looking for a specific file in a full of stuff directory. 
It makes sense that we can have an organizing tool ready to be used by just setting the 
absolute path into a second argument line in the terminal.

Usage: 
- Type: python main.py <Absolute/path/to/directory>
- Enjoy!
